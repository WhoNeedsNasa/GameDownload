This game allows children to safely interact with ICT's in order to develop necessary skills. \r\n\r\n•The Game is a 2D running based game. The Idea was from the original Super Mario game, and I believe it will be a great start for someone who doesn't have access to a Nintendo console. \r\n\r\n\r\n#The Game is still in Alpha stage and will be free to download. The download will only feature 1 level to test the market.\r\n\r\n##Download the game here: https://drive.google.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWebsite was created by Liam Hovey, using https://github.com/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
