</code></pre>




<p>•This game is suitable for 3-5 year olds as it contains no graphic or violent content. This game allows children to safely interact with ICT's in order to develop necessary skills. </p>

<p>•The Game is a 2D running based game. The Idea was from the original Super Mario game, and I believe it will be a great start for someone who doesn't have access to a Nintendo console. </p>
